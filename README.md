# ObjectDetection
2021 - 2022 Science Fair Project

Abstract:
The objective of the project is to create a machine capable of detecting a physical object. This ability is used by humans every day. By implementing object detection into machines, technology can do much more. The project machine is designed to detect a cup within a 1-meter square, then move to be within 10cm of the cup, and finally, turn on an attached LED light. The experimentation procedure starts with the machine placed at the center of an edge of the 1-meter square and the cup is placed at a randomly generated location within the 1-meter square. The program is then initiated with a push button and the machine is allowed to move. Once the LED light turns on, the distance between the cup and machine is recorded in centimeters. This process is repeated 10 times and the average distance will determine the success of the project. The average was 4.03cm, making the project successful. However, 4 trials resulted in a distance of 0 cm, meaning the machine made contact with the cup. Further research can achieve a consistent distance to the target, create faster results, and improve the mobility of the machine.â€‹
